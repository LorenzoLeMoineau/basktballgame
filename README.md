# basktballgame

EFREI project in Python. We made a 2D basketball game, where the user could throw a ball in the basket by draging his mouse on the ball. We implemented different physics elements like the gravity, the bounce of the ball, the speed, and the weight to make this game realistic.
We added a home menu with different options like rules, balls and play with all the graphical options to make this game more beautiful.
